This code does followings:

1. It loops through files in directory and save their names in the vector.
2. For each .csv file, the code deletes first seven rows and the first column.
3. For each .csv file, the code attach a new variable to the last column based on the file name.
  e.g.) if filename is "CHRG_77_L1.csv", the code put a new variable "L" to the new column of the .csv file
4. The code extracts the result as a csv file.
  
  *** I uploaded an example .csv file. The values are made by using rand() function in Microsoft Excel.
